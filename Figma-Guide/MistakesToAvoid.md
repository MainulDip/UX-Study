## Common Mistakes To Avoid While Working With Figma

1. Component Creation Mistakes
- Not Creating Components
Anything that will be copied should be made component first (outside)
Better create all the component first like React.js and copy/use them where needed
- Not using auto layout

- Not making variants
Make varients for components so that could be changed easily without editing itself

- What items to make component:

- Making larger component without making smaller/iner elements as components

2. Not making the component resizable
Change auto layout from fixed container to fill width And make space-between

3. Not Using Variants:
Combine items as variants where applicable

4. Not giving properties/elements/variants correct name
Give meaningful name for components/varients ect. For example, you can make two nav link varient, name it active-state or active and name the two variants as on and off 

5. Not using a base structure in complex components
Create a base structure first, make it component then 


6. Not giving variants text label same name

Figma will look for naming of the label on the left side also 

7. Not making interactive component
To make varients interactive, link them first using handle, then interaction action will appear to select the behavour. Giving precise instruction, animation is also attachable for developers instructions
